# odin-recipes

This project is a basic recipe website built as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The goal of the project is to practice and demonstrate foundational HTML skills.

## About the Project

The website consists of:
- A main index page with links to individual recipe pages.
- Multiple recipe pages that include details such as ingredients and cooking instructions.

This project is focused purely on practicing HTML structure and content creation. While the website won't include styling or advanced features at this stage, it provides a solid foundation for applying CSS and JavaScript in the future.

## Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, I will demonstrate:
- Structuring web pages using HTML.
- Creating and linking multiple HTML files.
- Writing semantic and well-organized HTML code.

## What's Next

Once the basic structure is complete, the project will be revisited to add styling with CSS and interactivity with JavaScript.
