        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Crispy, golden, and irresistibly delicious, this traditional Schnitzel recipe brings a taste of Austria to your table. Made with tender pork steaks or thin veal cutlets, this dish is known for its delicate crust and juicy, flavorful interior. The secret lies in pounding the meat thin for even cooking and coating it in a three-step process of seasoned flour, lightly beaten eggs, and breadcrumbs. The result is a perfectly crisp exterior that doesn't overpower the meat's natural taste.</p>
        <p>Fried to perfection in hot oil, the Schnitzels are served immediately to ensure they remain crunchy and fresh. Pair them with classic accompaniments like French fries, Spätzle, or a tangy German potato salad, along with a vibrant leafy green salad. A squeeze of fresh lemon and a garnish of parsley elevate the dish, adding brightness to each bite. This Schnitzel is a timeless favorite, combining simple ingredients with a meticulous method to deliver a meal that's comforting and elegant.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 boneless pork steaks or chops (to make Austrian Wienerschnitzel, use thin veal cutlets)</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>60 grams all-purpose flour, combined with 1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>75 grams plain breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>Oil for frying (use a neutral-tasting oil with a high smoke point)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the pork chops between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound them until just 6 millimeters thick with the flat side of a meat tenderizer. Lightly season both sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
            <li>Place the flour mixture, egg, and breadcrumbs in 3 separate shallow bowls. Dip the chops in the flour, the egg, and the breadcrumbs, coating both sides and all edges at each stage. Be careful not to press the breadcrumbs into the meat. Gently shake off the excess crumbs. Don't let the schnitzel sit in the coating, or they will not be as crispy once fried – fry immediately.</li>
            <li>Make sure the cooking oil is hot enough at this point (about 165 degrees Celsius) as you don't want the Schnitzel to sit around in the coating before frying. Use enough oil so that the Schnitzels "swim" in it. Fry the Schnitzel for about 2-3 minutes on both sides until a deep golden brown. Transfer briefly to a plate lined with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately with slices of fresh lemon and parsley sprigs. Serve with French fries, Spätzle or German potato salad, and a fresh leafy green salad.</li>
